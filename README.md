  Spicy Sea Shells Website
</h1>

This is the website for the Spicy Sea Shells, built with Gatsby.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Run `yarn install`**

1.  **Run the Development Build.**

    `gatsby develop`

    You can now continue editing and the site will auto-update. It's running on `http://localhost:8000`.

1.  **Build for Production**

    _Note: You don't need this to deploy to production. This is only for debugging._ To build a production-like environment, run `gatsby build`. To inspect that page, run `gatsby serve`.

1. **Deploy to Production**
    To deploy to production, simply commit your changes to master and push to GitHub. A web hook will take care of everything and re-deploy the site automatically.
